# rust--raytracer
Simple raytracer written in rust.
 This raytracer is a (badly written and unifinished) rust implementation of the C++ raytracer from this course : https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/nicolas.bonneel/teaching.html


# How to test
`git clone https://github.com/ddonatien/rust--raytracer`
`cd rust--raytracer`
`cargo run`
It will generate a bmp image of the scene.

# How to modify the rendered scene
The raytracer is only able to render spheres for the moment. To modify the scene, change radiuses, propreties or the number of spheres between lines 242-263.
